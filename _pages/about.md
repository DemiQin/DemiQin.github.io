Hello! Welcome to the space of ç§¦ç‘œ, and you can call me Demi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Tulane University, specializing in machine learning, topological data analysis, and scientific visualization. My dissertation, titled [Metric Learning on Topological Descriptors](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFNSh0oR60/j7udMbLvBw3E9MfwJKfgGA/view?utm_content=DAFNSh0oR60&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink#2) is advised by Prof. [Brian Summa](https://tulanevisgraphics.bitbucket.io/) and Prof. [Carola Wenk](https://www.cs.tulane.edu/~carola/). In my research, I push the boundaries of how we understand and interpret complex datasets efficiently.

My research develops computational methods that simplify and clarify complex data patterns, especially in large datasets. I leverage **machine learning** and **visualization** to understand data structures and similarities from a **topological** perspective. I create models that not only measure data similarities at scale but also explain the 'why' behind these similarities. My work finds applications in diverse areas: enhancing medical imaging techniques for better diagnostic accuracy, advancing our understanding of climate models for more precise weather forecasting and climate change analysis, and increasing efficiency in supply chain management.
