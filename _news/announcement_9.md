ðŸŒŸ Our paper  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18772">"Learning production functions for supply chains with graph neural networks"</a> has been accpeted for an oral presentation at AAAI 2025 (top 5%)! This work was done during my internship at Hitachi in collaboration with Stanford. We introduce a novel class of models for supply chain optimization by integrating temporal GNNs with an innovative inventory module.
