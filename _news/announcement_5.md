ðŸ›Ž I'm participating in the **[ICML Topological Deep Learning Challenge 2024](https://pyt-team.github.io/packs/challenge.html)**! I'm proposing a novel topological lifting approach based on node attributes to convert a graph into a hypergraph. Check out our implementation details [here](https://github.com/pyt-team/challenge-icml-2024/pull/40).
