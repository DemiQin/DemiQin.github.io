âœ¨ **New Paper!** We introduce Merge Tree Neural Networks (MTNN), a leanred neural network model specifically designed for merge tree comparison. MTNN dramatically enhances the speed and quality of similarity computations, and speeds up the prior state-of-the-art by more than 100x on the benchmark datasets while maintaining an error rate below 0.1%, more details on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05879">[paper]</a>.
